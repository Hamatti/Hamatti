# Hi, I'm Juhis

[![hamatti.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/-hamatti.org-%23971226?link=https://hamatti.org)](https://hamatti.org)

I'm a community builder, a public speaker and a web developer currently living in Turku, Finland.

I love learning, teaching and sharing what I've learned. I publish [a weekly blog](https://hamatti.org/blog), [speak in tech events](https://hamatti.org/speaking) and teach/coach in programming workshops and mentor junior developers.

I run [Turku ❤️  Frontend](https://turkufrontend.fi) and [archipylago](https://archipylago.dev), both local meetup communities.

In social media, you can find me at <a href="https://mastodon.world/@hamatti" rel="me">Mastodon</a>.

## Some of my best talks

[Debugging Python](https://hamatti.org/talks/debugging-python/)

>  Debugging can be a stressful experience to a developer. In this talk, I provide practical and hands-on tips both for dealing both with the processes and approaches as well as the technical tools and approaches that can help Python developers turn stressful debugging situations into joyful experiences. 

[Contemporary Documentation](https://hamatti.org/talks/contemporary-documentation/)

> Teams change often. People leave and people join. In addition to those changes, we tend to forget what we were thinking. That's why it's a good practice to document those thoughts, discussions and decisions into a format that doesn't lose them.

[Why developers should write blog posts](https://notes.hamatti.org/my-projects/talks/why-developers-should-write-blog-posts-(talk))

> Writing down what you learn and think is a powerful tool and sharing them with others can have a big impact in your life. I’ve been blogging about technology on and off since 2013 and more consistently since 2018. In this talk I share what I’ve learned by blogging as a developer and hope to inspire you to pick up your proverbial pen and start writing.

[Build a portfolio](https://notes.hamatti.org/my-projects/talks/build-a-portfolio-(talk))

> How to gain experience before you have experience? This talk is aimed to anyone either at the beginning of their developer career or at any spot where they want to stand out from the crowd when looking for a job. Juhis walks you through how to come up with portfolio project ideas, how to showcase them and how to use them effectively when looking for a job.

[Learning in public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXEORvNKYvc)

> By documenting his own learning journey and experimentations and sharing what he has learned about software development, Juhis has ended up in a lot of great discussions with fellow developers. These discussions have further helped him become better at writing software.

[I teach, therefore I learn](https://hamatti.org/talks/i-teach-therefore-i-learn/)

> There are many ways to improve your skills as a developer. Teaching programming is an awesome but bit under-appreciated one. Becoming a senior developer is about so much more than just technical competency. It’s about helping others succeed, it’s about becoming a leader and it’s about being a good communicator with users, clients and teammates.

[Lightning talk: Self-documenting code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8Un1w30IDk)

> Some people argue that good code is self-documenting. But code can only tell you what or how but not why. In this funny 5-minute lightning talk I'll demonstrate why.

[Lightning talk: Comparing version numbers](https://hamatti.org/slides/comparing)

> Comparing version numbers sounds relatively straight-forward until you go down the rabbit hole and explore the world of different systems. This 5-minute lightning talk is half educational, half makes-people-laugh entertaining look into the wild world of versioning systems.
