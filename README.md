# Hi, I'm Juhis

[![Twitter: Juha-Matti Santala](https://img.shields.io/badge/-twitter-%231DA1F2?logo=twitter&logoColor=white&link=https://twitter.com/hamatti)](https://twitter.com/hamatti) [![hamatti.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/-hamatti.org-%23971226?link=https://hamatti.org)](https://hamatti.org)

I'm a community builder, a public speaker and a web developer currently living in Helsinki, Finland.

I work as a Developer Advocate at [Futurice](https://futurice.com) and I love learning, teaching and sharing what I've learned. I publish [a weekly blog](https://hamatti.org/blog), [speak in tech events](https://hamatti.org/speaking) and teach/coach in programming workshops and mentor junior developers.

I run [Turku ❤️  Frontend](https://turkufrontend.fi) and [Helsinki Dev Lunch](https://helsinkidevlunch.org/) and I'm active in [Koodiklinikka community](https://koodiklinikka.fi/).

I'm also the host of [codebase](https://hamatti.org), a developer community Youtube show.

## Things I've written

[Humane Guide to Python Errors](https://hamatti.org/guides/humane-guide-to-python-errors/) helps you navigate the error messages of Python programs.

[Humane Guide to Debugging Web Apps](https://hamatti.org/guides/humane-guide-to-debugging/) gets you to the next level on your debugging skills – a crucial part of being a software developer.

[How to scrape a website with Python & BeautifulSoup](https://hamatti.org/posts/how-to-scrape-website-with-python-beautifulsoup/) is a popular resource for anyone who wants to get started with getting data from websites to their own scripts.

[You should start a blog today](https://hamatti.org/posts/you-should-start-a-blog-today/) shares my motivation for blogging and how blogging is a valuable tool for software developers who want to advance their careers.

[Minimal Travel Table Top Game Collection](https://hamatti.org/posts/minimal-travel-tabletop-game-collection/) is a fun side project I did to make my own board gaming hobby more compatible with travelling.

## Some of my best talks

[Contemporary Documentation](https://hamatti.org/talks/contemporary-documentation/)

> Teams change often. People leave and people join. In addition to those changes, we tend to forget what we were thinking. That's why it's a good practice to document those thoughts, discussions and decisions into a format that doesn't lose them.

[Learning in public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXEORvNKYvc)

> By documenting his own learning journey and experimentations and sharing what he has learned about software development, Juhis has ended up in a lot of great discussions with fellow developers. These discussions have further helped him become better at writing software.

[I teach, therefore I learn](https://hamatti.org/talks/i-teach-therefore-i-learn/)

> There are many ways to improve your skills as a developer. Teaching programming is an awesome but bit under-appreciated one. Becoming a senior developer is about so much more than just technical competency. It’s about helping others succeed, it’s about becoming a leader and it’s about being a good communicator with users, clients and teammates.

[Lightning talk: Self-documenting code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8Un1w30IDk)

> Some people argue that good code is self-documenting. But code can only tell you what or how but not why. In this funny 5-minute lightning talk I'll demonstrate why.

## What do I build?

On my freetime, I love to build small projects for myself and for the communities I'm involved in. Here are some of the highlights:

### 235

[235](https://github.com/Hamatti/nhl-235) is a command-line tool that brings NHL results directly to your terminal while being a tribute and homage to YLE's tekstitv page 235.

### Pokemon related stuff

[card-print-css](https://github.com/Hamatti/card-print-css) is a CSS styling that turns any number of `<img>` (of playing cards) on a page into the correct size for cutting and sleeving when printed on A4 page. I use it for prototyping, playtesting and proxying.

[jklac-proxy-builder](https://github.com/Hamatti/jklac-proxy-builder) is a set of tools to turn decklists from [Jason Klaczynki's great blog](https://jklaczpokemon.wordpress.com/) into proxies for testing.

[ptcgo-parser](https://github.com/Hamatti/ptcgo-parser) is a NMP package for parsing PTCGO deck lists into PokemonTCG.io API compatible format.

[pkmn-attack-damage](https://github.com/Hamatti/pkmn-attack-damage) is a web app that allows users to search for cards in expanded and standard format for specific damage value.

[proxymon](https://github.com/Hamatti/proxymon) is a bit outdated tool for printing proxies based on PTCGO deck lists.

_work in progress_: I'm building an online multiplayer cube draft tool for Pokemon TCG players as well. It's still very early stages so the code is not yet open source.
