# Hi, I'm Juhis

[![Twitter: Juha-Matti Santala](https://img.shields.io/badge/-twitter-%231DA1F2?logo=twitter&logoColor=white&link=https://twitter.com/hamatti)](https://twitter.com/hamatti) [![hamatti.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/-hamatti.org-%23971226?link=https://hamatti.org)](https://hamatti.org)

I'm a community builder, a public speaker and a web developer currently living in Berlin, Germany.

I love learning, teaching and sharing what I've learned. I publish [a weekly blog](https://hamatti.org/blog), [speak in tech events](https://hamatti.org/speaking) and teach/coach in programming workshops and mentor junior developers.

I work as a developer advocate for [Firefox add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/) at [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/).

Outside work, I run [Turku ❤️  Frontend](https://turkufrontend.fi), coach students in [codebar](https://codebar.io/) and I'm active in [Koodiklinikka community](https://koodiklinikka.fi/).

I'm also the host of [codebase](https://hamatti.org/codebase), a developer community Youtube show.

## Things I've written

[Humane Guide to Python Errors](https://hamatti.org/guides/humane-guide-to-python-errors/) helps you navigate the error messages of Python programs.

[Humane Guide to Debugging Web Apps](https://hamatti.org/guides/humane-guide-to-debugging/) gets you to the next level on your debugging skills – a crucial part of being a software developer.

[How to scrape a website with Python & BeautifulSoup](https://hamatti.org/posts/how-to-scrape-website-with-python-beautifulsoup/) is a popular resource for anyone who wants to get started with getting data from websites to their own scripts.

[You should start a blog today](https://hamatti.org/posts/you-should-start-a-blog-today/) shares my motivation for blogging and how blogging is a valuable tool for software developers who want to advance their careers.

[Minimal Travel Table Top Game Collection](https://hamatti.org/posts/minimal-travel-tabletop-game-collection/) is a fun side project I did to make my own board gaming hobby more compatible with travelling.

[kittens-everywhere – how to build a browser extension](https://hamatti.org/posts/kittens-everywhere-how-to-build-a-browser-extension/) is my first tutorial on how to build a browser extension for Firefox. It's based on a class I taught in September 2022, converted into a blog format.

## Some of my best talks

[Contemporary Documentation](https://hamatti.org/talks/contemporary-documentation/)

> Teams change often. People leave and people join. In addition to those changes, we tend to forget what we were thinking. That's why it's a good practice to document those thoughts, discussions and decisions into a format that doesn't lose them.

[Learning in public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXEORvNKYvc)

> By documenting his own learning journey and experimentations and sharing what he has learned about software development, Juhis has ended up in a lot of great discussions with fellow developers. These discussions have further helped him become better at writing software.

[I teach, therefore I learn](https://hamatti.org/talks/i-teach-therefore-i-learn/)

> There are many ways to improve your skills as a developer. Teaching programming is an awesome but bit under-appreciated one. Becoming a senior developer is about so much more than just technical competency. It’s about helping others succeed, it’s about becoming a leader and it’s about being a good communicator with users, clients and teammates.

[Lightning talk: Self-documenting code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8Un1w30IDk)

> Some people argue that good code is self-documenting. But code can only tell you what or how but not why. In this funny 5-minute lightning talk I'll demonstrate why.

## What do I build?

On my freetime, I love to build small projects for myself and for the communities I'm involved in. Here are some of the highlights:

### 235

[235](https://github.com/Hamatti/nhl-235) is a command-line tool that brings NHL results directly to your terminal while being a tribute and homage to YLE's tekstitv page 235.

You can read more about it at [Introducing: 235](https://hamatti.org/posts/introducing-235/).

### Pokemon related stuff

[Pokemon TCG card viewer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pokemon-tcg-card-viewer/) a Firefox extension for Pokemon TCG players. When activated, makes Pokemon TCG Online card codes (in format of `BRS 120`) hoverable and will show the card image on hover. This makes it easy to check cards and what they do when reading through decklists in Youtube descriptions, blogs or forum posts.

[Pokemon TCG Online Redeem Code Helper](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/pokemon-tcg-online-code-helper/) a Firefox extension to help Pokemon TCG players when redeeming large amounts of bulk codes in Pokemon TCG Online client.

[gym-leader-challenge-deck-validator](https://github.com/Hamatti/gym-leader-challenge-deck-validator) is a web application for validating deck lists used in [Pokémon TCG Gym Leader Challenge](https://gymleaderchallenge.com/) format. The app can be used at [https://glc-checker.netlify.app/](https://glc-checker.netlify.app/).

[card-print-css](https://github.com/Hamatti/card-print-css) is a CSS styling that turns any number of `<img>` (of playing cards) on a page into the correct size for cutting and sleeving when printed on A4 page. I use it for prototyping, playtesting and proxying.

[jklac-proxy-builder](https://github.com/Hamatti/jklac-proxy-builder) is a set of tools to turn decklists from [Jason Klaczynki's great blog](https://jklaczpokemon.wordpress.com/) into proxies for testing.

[ptcgo-parser](https://github.com/Hamatti/ptcgo-parser) is a NMP package for parsing PTCGO deck lists into PokemonTCG.io API compatible format.

[pkmn-attack-damage](https://github.com/Hamatti/pkmn-attack-damage) is a web app that allows users to search for cards in expanded and standard format for specific damage value.

[prism-extension-ptcgo](https://github.com/Hamatti/prism-extension-ptcgo) is an extension to syntax highlight library Prism.js that provides syntax highlighting for Pokemon deck lists.

[proxymon](https://github.com/Hamatti/proxymon) is a bit outdated tool for printing proxies based on PTCGO deck lists.

_work in progress_: I'm building an online multiplayer cube draft tool for Pokemon TCG players as well. It's still very early stages so the code is not yet open source.

### Board Game related projects
