# Hi, I'm Juhis

I'm a community builder, a public speaker and a web developer currently living in Helsinki, Finland.

You can find more about me on [my website](https://hamatti.org).

## What do I build?

On my freetime, I love to build small projects for myself and for the communities I'm involved in. Here are some of the highlights:

### 235

[235](https://github.com/Hamatti/nhl-235) is a command-line tool that brings NHL results directly to your terminal while being a tribute and homage to YLE's tekstitv page 235.

### Pokemon related stuff

[card-print-css](https://github.com/Hamatti/card-print-css) is a CSS styling that turns any number of `<img>` (of playing cards) on a page into the correct size for cutting and sleeving when printed on A4 page. I use it for prototyping, playtesting and proxying.

[jklac-proxy-builder](https://github.com/Hamatti/jklac-proxy-builder) is a set of tools to turn decklists from [Jason Klaczynki's great blog](https://jklaczpokemon.wordpress.com/) into proxies for testing.

[ptcgo-parser](https://github.com/Hamatti/ptcgo-parser) is a NMP package for parsing PTCGO deck lists into PokemonTCG.io API compatible format.

[pkmn-attack-damage](https://github.com/Hamatti/pkmn-attack-damage) is a web app that allows users to search for cards in expanded and standard format for specific damage value.

[proxymon](https://github.com/Hamatti/proxymon) is a bit outdated tool for printing proxies based on PTCGO deck lists.

_work in progress_: I'm building an online multiplayer cube draft tool for Pokemon TCG players as well. It's still very early stages so the code is not yet open source.

### Browser extensions and bookmarklets

[viaplay-keyboard-shortcuts](https://github.com/Hamatti/viaplay-keyboard-shortcuts) adds (f)ull screen and (m)ute keyboard shortcuts to Viaplay's streaming service.

[teliatv-keyboard-shortcuts](https://github.com/Hamatti/teliatv-keyboard-shortcuts) adds (f)ull screen and (m)ute keyboard shortcuts to Telia TV's streaming service.

[blur-old-youtube-videos](https://github.com/Hamatti/blur-old-youtube-videos) extension allows you to blur recommended videos that are older than 1 year to make it easier to find recent videos.

[on24-bookmarklet](https://gist.github.com/Hamatti/11de9fd64e226738c00c8a8b2fad024e) adds support for keyboard/presentation clicker to switch slides when presenting with ON24 webinar platform.

[areena-live-chat-remover](https://gist.github.com/Hamatti/5f33ce7fd1554e43fb8527b6268a6acd) removes YLE Areena's live chat.

### Board Game related projects

[flamme-rouge-bot-companion](https://github.com/Hamatti/flamme-rouge-bot-companion) is a web app that makes playing Flamme Rouge with bots more manageable.

[flamme-rouge-bot-companion-script](https://github.com/Hamatti/flamme-rouge-bot-companion-script) is a CLI tool that makes playing Flamme Rouge with bots more manageable.

[taajuus](https://github.com/Hamatti/taajuus) is an online adaptation of Wavelength board game for video call gaming.
